## Quick Start

### Android

1. Install dependencies and build the client libraries locally with `yarn`.
2. Start the React Native packager, build the application, and start the simulator with `yarn android`.

## Development

After making changes to any of the client libraries in `js/packages/` you will need to re-run `yarn` in this directory. This will rebuild the client libraries and copy their build artifacts into the `node_modules/` folder of this example app.
